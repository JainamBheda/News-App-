render() method is used to render HTML of component react ....which is only used in class based component

componentDidMount() runs after component output has been rendered to the componentDidMount

Most of cases componentDidMount() is used when we fetch the api , ..etc

if state is changed in component use componentDidUpdate()

componentwillUnMount() is called before component is destroyed 

constructor() runs before render()
